## file structure

### autorun scripts
Auto run scripts are prepended with `run_once`.
They are run in lexicographic order.
I've decided that the format will be run_once_{global priority}_{platform}_{platform priority}_{script_name}.tmpl

The file type is .tmpl. This is so that we can wrap the script in the template format conditional.
```
{{- if eq .chezmoi.os "darwin" -}}
...
{{ end -}}
```
This way, the file is only run if we are on the appropriate platform. This is because chezmoi will not run blank files.
